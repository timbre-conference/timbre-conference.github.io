#### Timbre poses multifaceted research questions at the intersection of psychology, cognitive neuroscience, musicology, acoustics, and engineering. Bringing together researchers from these and related fields, the [International Conference on Timbre](/conferences/) aims to provide a truly interdisciplinary forum for exchanging novel perspectives and forging collaborations across different disciplines to help address challenges in our understanding of timbre from empirical, theoretical, and computational perspectives.

<br>
The scientific discourse on timbre has been gaining momentum since the mid 2010s from audio acoustics and music cognition to sound design and artificial intelligence. Following the [Berlin Interdisciplinary Workshop on Timbre](http://www.timbre2017.tu-berlin.de/) (2017) and the international conference [Timbre 2018: Timbre is a Many-Splendored Thing](https://www.mcgill.ca/timbre2018/) (2018), the goal of the [International Conference on Timbre](/conferences/) is to continue a tradition of triennial meetings around timbre. Establishing a periodic gathering will help forge more solid bonds among the members of the emerging cross-disciplinary community.

<br>
This website serves as the permanent home for historical records, proceedings, and planning documents and policies related to future editions of the Timbre conference.
